TITLE : Driver Drowsiness Detection 
DESCRIPTION : "Awake at the Wheel" is an innovative project aimed at enhancing road safety by leveraging machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate driver drowsiness. Drowsy driving poses a significant risk on roads worldwide, leading to numerous accidents and fatalities each year. Through this project, we endeavor to develop a robust and efficient system capable of identifying signs of driver drowsiness in real-time, thereby alerting drivers and potentially preventing accidents.

Using a diverse dataset comprising images or videos of drivers under different states of alertness, our project employs advanced machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns associated with drowsiness. Key features such as facial landmarks, eye movements, and head pose are extracted and utilized to train our models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for their effectiveness in image classification tasks, allowing us to accurately differentiate between alert and drowsy states. and this will also send the details about location .

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES : The problem solved by the project "Awake at the Wheel: Machine Learning Approaches to Detecting Driver Drowsiness" is the significant risk posed by drowsy driving on roads worldwide. Drowsy driving is a pervasive issue that can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. Despite efforts to raise awareness, many drivers still underestimate the dangers of driving while fatigued, often resulting in tragic consequences.

This project addresses the problem by developing a robust and efficient system capable of detecting signs of driver drowsiness in real-time. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system can analyze various indicators of drowsiness, such as facial expressions, eye movements, and head pose, to accurately identify when a driver is becoming drowsy.
